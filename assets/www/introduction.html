                <h3> Introduction</h3>
                <p align="justify"> The bad news? If your first language is English, you routinely make thousands of language sounds
				that don't even exist in Japanese, and Japanese and English grammar are about as different as sushi and sandwiches. 
				But what's life without a little challenge, right? </p>
				
				<p align="justify">But there's a good side even to the bad news. On the pronunciation front, Japanese sounds are few and pure. 
				When I say pure, I mean that there aren't so-called glides like there are in English. A glide is when you start 
				out making one vowel sound and then ever-so-subtly glide into a different one. For example, listen to yourself carefully 
				as you say the word "no." You'll notice that you don't make just an "oh" sound, but you tack a little "ooh" sound onto the
				end. You can verify this by noticing that your lips actually move, which would be unnecessary for just one simple vowel 
				sound. If you don't believe me, look in the mirror and say it slowly, because you definitely do it. </p>

				<p align="justify">These glides are just one aspect of English that give it a large total number of language sounds. 
				When I talk about language sounds, I'm talking about the one-syllable building blocks that you can 
				use to make any word in a given language. Care to hazard a guess at how many basic sound ingredients there are in English? 
				It varies by dialect, but one estimate puts the number at over 8000. </p>
