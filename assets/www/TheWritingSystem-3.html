                <h3>The Writing System</h3>
                <p align="justify">
				Let's get back to the story. Our early Japanese friends began writing their language 
				using Chinese characters. But the Chinese writing system was complicated to begin with, 
				and now that we were trying to use it to write an altogether different language, it was
				even worse. So it took a lot of training and practice to master the system, which meant 
				that only the rich and powerful could afford the time and effort to learn it.

				</p>
				
				<p align="justify">But here's where it gets interesting. Japanese culture at the time believed 
				that women were not capable of learning such a complex system, so even the women who happened 
				to be born into wealthy families generally were not educated deeply in using Chinese characters. 
				But these women wanted to write. So they began to do something quite extraordinary. 
				For each syllable they wished to express, they chose a Chinese character that could be 
				pronounced that way, and used the character to represent only that sound, discarding the 
				actual meaning of the character. 

				</p>

				<p align="justify">
				For example, the Japanese word for "sky" is sora.But instead of using this character, these women chose one character that could be 
				pronounced so and another that could be pronounced ra. They put them together and said, "Totally
				disregard what the characters mean in Chinese. Just pronounce them out loud to make a Japanese word."
