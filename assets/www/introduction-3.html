				If you're a grammar-phobe, don't worry. I'm right there with you. In fact, until I began to study Japanese, 
				I saw no use for grammar whatsoever. I couldn't tell you what a subject or an object was, let alone the harder
				items like articles and participles. So don't fret. I'm not going to turn into your eighth grade English teacher 
				and have you graph sentences.

				Actually, the name of this software, Human Japanese, is meant to describe my approach to this whole concept
				of learning a language. In my experience, there seem to be two main approaches to language. The first is the
				memorization camp. These people pick up a phrase book and just memorize all the key sentences. You probably know 
				someone from the office who can ask for a beer in 50 different languages. That's great, but what happens when you
				want to ask what kinds of beer are available, or where the beer was made, or how you can send a beer to that attractive
				person across the room? With the phrase approach, if you don't know the phrase, you're out of luck.


				</p>

				<p align="justify">
				
				The other camp is the grammar-centric camp. These people say, look, if you don't know the grammar, you're stuck with
				whatever tiny number of sentences you can memorize. If you understand how to string the words together, you can make 
				any sentence you want. And they're absolutely right. The trouble is that a lot of the books that take this approach get 
				so bogged down in the endless details that the poor student, coming in as a healthy, fun-loving individual, gets turned 
				off by the clinical sterility and gives up.
