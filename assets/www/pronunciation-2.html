                <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
                <p align="justify"> Another note: In Japanese, letters don't have names like in English. For example, 
				we call the letter i "eye" no matter how it's actually being used in a word. Its name is "eye." 
				But in Japanese, letters are just called by how they're pronounced. So when I refer to the sound u, 
				you shouldn't read it "you." You should say "ooh," just like it's pronounced. 


				</p>
				
				<p align="justify">As to the order of the vowels above, this is their proper order in Japanese. 
				We'll learn more about this later.
				</p>

				<p align="justify"><b>Doubled Vowels</b><p align="justify">

				In English, when two vowels sit next to each other in a word, they play mysterious games with 
				their pronunciation. For example, add an extra e to "bet" and you get a totally different pronunciation,
				"beet." The word "been" is yet different. 

					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
					Japanese has none of this nonsense. When two of the same vowel come in a row, the sound simply lasts twice as
					long. The vowel sound doesn't change - it just lasts longer. If you were to tap your finger at regular intervals,
					the word oku would take two beats (o-ku), while ooku would take three beats (o-o-ku). In fact, we can literally say
					that the latter is a three-syllable word.

					</p>
					
					<p align="justify">
					When first learning about doubled vowels, it's a good idea to tap your finger while saying the word. Each syllable 
					should get the same length of time. It's really important to give those doubled vowels and consonants (see below) 
					their full value. And yes, it definitely can affect the meaning of your words.
