				But soon challenges appear. Take the sentence, "He bought the cat." The first and last characters are easy.
				But what about the word "the"? The Chinese language doesn't have this word, so obviously there is no
				character for it. What to do? Someone comes up with the idea of recycling an old character that isn't 
				used much in Chinese for the word "the" in English.

				<p align="justify">But what about the word "bought"? Chinese usually represents past tense verbs by
				using the present tense verb ("buy" in this case) plus another character which makes it past tense.
				So now we have to use two Chinese characters to get the one English word "bought."

				As you can see, trying to write English using characters that were designed for 
				Chinese would soon become fairly complex, above and beyond the simple fact that we 
				are forced to learn a large number of characters. And that same problem occurred when 
				those early pioneers tried to graft Chinese characters onto the very, very different language 
				that is Japanese. In fact, in my opinion, it would be much easier to write English using Chinese
				characters than Japanese. (The fictional examples above are a cakewalk compared to what ancient 
				Japanese written in Chinese characters looks like.)
