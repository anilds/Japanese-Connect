				And when it comes to the grammar, what may seem challenging is really a blessing in disguise. 
				See, when people learn languages that are similar in structure and word-order to their own, they 
				often approach the language as if it were a code where you simply take an English sentence and then 
				swap out each word in order to create the translation, when that's really not the case. People who
				do this never really get a deep understanding of their target language, so they'll only be able to 
				speak it in bits and pieces at best (not to mention causing a great deal of head-scratching for the poor
				souls who try to understand them).</p>

				<p align="justify">With Japanese, the grammar is so unlike English that you won't be tempted to fall into this trap.
				I once had a friend who would take an English sentence and then look up each word in an English-Japanese dictionary 
				and write down the first entry for each one to build "Japanese" sentences, and the results were the most hilariously
				unintelligible things you could ever imagine. So the long and short of this is that you'll have no choice but to really 
				understand the nuts and bolts of the language, and that means you'll be able to speak it well.</p>
