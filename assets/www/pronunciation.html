                <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
                <p align="justify"> First things first. To start our journey in Japanese, we've got to know how to pronounce it.
				As it turns out, Japanese pronunciation is very straightforward compared to English. As a general rule, one letter 
				is pronounced only one way, and as I mentioned before, there aren't very many sounds to begin with, so you're probably 
				in for a pleasant surprise </p>
				
				<p align="justify">Before we look at the vowels, I'd like to say a word about Romanization. Romanization means writing 
				words from another language in the alphabet that we use in English, the Roman alphabet. Typically, we tend to think of 
				our alphabet as the "English alphabet," but the fact of the matter is that the characters A to Z are used - with a few 
				minor variations - in very many languages besides English. Our alphabet is actually called the Roman alphabet, since it 
				goes all the way back to Latin. </p>

				<p align="justify">It's handy to be able to read and write Japanese using Roman letters, because that way we can start 
				learning Japanese words without having to know how to read Japanese characters. It lets us jump right into the study of 
				the language itself. But Roman letters really don't cut it for any sort of true study of Japanese. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Japanese has two "alphabets," more accurately called syllabaries. That name stems from the fact that, unlike English, 
				where one letter represents just a part of a sound (try to pronounce a k by itself), every letter in the syllabaries 
				represents an entire sound, or syllable. So just one letter, all by itself, can be read "ka."
