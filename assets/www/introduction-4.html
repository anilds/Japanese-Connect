				As you're probably beginning to guess, I lean more toward the second camp than the first. 
				I'm not going to lie to you. Grammar is extremely important. But gosh darn it, a language
				is such a huge, fun, incredible, scary, cool thing, that if people are going to learn one, 
				they need to have fun doing it. They need lessons from someone who speaks their language, 
				someone who speaks in real, warm, human terms. And I believe that I'm your guy. 

				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				
				So this is what we're going to do. We're going to learn all the really important grammar stuff, 
				but each time I use a new term or introduce a new concept, I'll make sure you understand exactly 
				what it is and why it's important. I'll show you how it relates to similar concepts in English. 
				I'll even make the explanations funny and interesting to read. By the time we're done with this, 
				you'll not only understand Japanese, but I'd wager that you'll understand English a good deal better as well.

				</p>

				<p align="justify">
				
				Along the way, we'll be seeing hundreds of new vocabulary words. Whenever you see any word written in 
				Japanese characters in the main text, click it to hear a recording. That's rule number one all Japanese 
				words have recordings attached.
